  * * Author:  Chris E. Hogan Alvin A. Arens, Randal J. Elder, Mark S. Beasley
   
  * Comprehensive and up-to-date, including discussion of new standards, codes, and concepts, Auditing and Assurance Services: An Integrated Approach presents an integrated approach to auditing that details the process from start to finish. Based on the authors’ belief that the fundamental concepts of auditing centre on the nature and amount of evidence that auditors should gather in specific engagements, the text’s primary objective is to illustrate auditing concepts using practical examples and real-world settings. Using key real audit decisions as their foundation, students can successfully conduct an audit according to a financial reporting framework.
